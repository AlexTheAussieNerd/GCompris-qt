"export_layers_gcompris" is an Inkscape extension to help creating maps/puzzle content in SVG.
(requires Inkscape 1.0 or above ;
better use a distribution packages on GNU/Linux as it may not work with Appimages but YMMV..)

Usage example:

-Copy the two files (.inx and .py) in ~/.config/inkscape/extensions.

-NOTE: to avoid issues, make sure to setup your inkscape document width "Display units" in px, and with scale value 1.0 for x and y
 (in "Document Properties", sections "General" and "Scale")
 
-Create an SVG file with a base shape, like a country, on the first layer, and give a proper name to the layer,
 like the country's name.
-Make the base shape fill color white, and the outline color dark blue or black, with a 1px width.
-Create a new layer, and using the fill tool create a shape for a region. Name this layer with the region's name.
-Repeat the previous line as needed to complete all the regions. Make each region with a different fill color,
 and the outline color darker with a 0.5px width.

-When all is ready and saved, go in the menu "Extensions" - "Export" - "Export layers GCompris..."
-Leave all the default settings (all the checkboxes unchecked, "Fit document size to layer content" selected and "SVG" selected) and click on Apply.

-The result files will be in ~/.config/inkscape/extensions/layers, unless you selected something in "Source file" in which case the layers folder will be next to this file.
