maps reference sources

All the maps (except romania-historical and lithuania-cultural) were created based on data from OpenStreetMap (downloaded with https://osm-boundaries.com/), converted to svg with geojson-to-svg (https://www.npmjs.com/package/geojson-to-svg), and then heavily edited in Inkscape.

romania-historical map was based on a mix of OSM data and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Romania_historic_regions.svg , with heavy editing in Inkscape.

lithuania-cultural map was based on a mix of OSM data and https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Liet-etno-regionai.png , with heavy editing in Inkscape.

Steps to create country regions map:

-Get map of country data from https://osm-boundaries.com/
(select country, admin level min and max 4, file format GeoJSON, Land only, Simplify: Some less (0.1), or Even less (0.01) if Some less is not detailed enough)

-extract *.kmz file to *.kmz.uncompressed

-convert kmz.uncompressed file to svg with https://www.npmjs.com/package/geojson-to-svg
(example: ./geojson2svg --input OSMB-myFile.kmz.uncompressed > countryName.svg

-open the svg file in inkscape

-as the converted svg appears to be upside down, select everything, and press V key to mirror everything vertically

-in document properties, make sure that the Scale x and y are at 1.0, and the Viewbox X and Y are at 0.0.

-Set the document size to 500px per 500px

-select everything, lock the size ratio and set the biggest side (width or height) to 480px

-set the document side again to adjust the width or height (example: if the content is 480px width and 203px height, set the document height to 203px, that is at least 20px more than the content height and rounded to the next tens.)

-with everything selected, center the content vertically and horizontally inside the document page.

-create a new layer named [back]country_name

-cut all the content, and paste it in place in the new layer

-set the contents style: fill color pure white (#ffffffff), and the outline 0.5px and color #505050ff

-ungroup (shift+g) the content to get separate regions as single items

-for each region: create a new layer, name it with the region's name, cut the region from the back layer (ctrl+x) and paste it in place in the new layer (ctrl+alt+v)

-select all the objects, and remove their outline

-hide all the layers, and then for each layer, make it visible, and at zoom level between 200% and 300% (adapt to get the level of detail you want, but most importantly use the same zoom level for all the regions, and don't use a zoom level higher than 300% to keep the result small enough) use the fill tool on the region's shape to create a new shape for it, more simplified (this is needed as the imported shapes are often too heavy and not very optimized; the fill tool helps here to create a new shape more optimized while keeping the shape similar enough). NOTE: if a region is made of several shapes, fill them all, then select them all and join the shapes (with ctrl++). Fill Tool tips: first in the document settings, set the background color to a dark grey; then when using the fill tool, set its settings to Fill by: Alpha, Threshold: 50, Grow/shrink by:0, Close gaps: None.

-delete all the original imported shapes (tip: select the newly created shape, move it down with the button "Lower selection to bottom (End)", select the original shape that is now on top and delete it.)

-select all the shapes, and set their fill color to #e77936ff, and their outline size to 0.5px and color to #505050ff.

-select one shape after the other, and change their color by just shifting their hue (in Fill Flat color, with HSL selected, move the H slider) to get different colors for each region. You can also at some point increase a bit the L slider to get more variations with lighter colors.

-on the [back] layer, create a rectangle of the same size as the document, without outline, and position it at 0,0 coordinates, and set its fill color to mid grey (#808080ff)

-copy all the shapes, select the [back] layer and paste them all in place, and set their fill color to #ffffffff

-Save the file as inkscape compressed svgz

-install the inksacpe extension "Export Layers GCompris", and use it to export all the layers to separated svg files and a text file with the coordinates for each region (they will be found after export in ~/.config/inkscape/extension/layers/ )

-copy the script convertSvgToSvgz.sh inside this layers folder and run it to convert all svg to svgz, then do rm -f *.svg to delete the svg and keep only the svgz files

-copy the source svgz file (with all the map and regions) in MapSources in geo-country, and copy the exported separated layer svgz files to a folder with the country name in resources.

-create a board file for the country (look at other board files to copy the structure), and use the coordinates from the text file for each region
